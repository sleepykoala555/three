        <h1><span>1. Introduction</span></h1>
        <p class="text">In this project, we design an interactive high-fidelity prototype of a telehealth and
          appointment scheduling mobile app for the start-up named Almond. First, we present some sketches that we
          created to brainstorm some ideas, then we move on to the low-fidelity prototype. Afterward, we present the
          final 5-10 screens of high fidelity prototype of the mobile app.

          <b> Start-up:</b> Almond
        </p>
        <p class="text2"><b>Description:</b> Almond is a telehealth application for women’s health. Almond makes it easy
          to get great ObGyn care fast, both at in-person offices and over telehealth.</p>
        <p class="text2"><b>Context:</b> The problem with traditional ObGyn practices is that physician time is misused,
          so patients get slow care. Almond is rebuilding back-office tech that saves physicians time and is hiring a
          wider range of care providers roles, which allows Almond to deliver better outcomes to patients and reduce the
          amount of time it takes to get their issues resolved.

          <h2>Notes for Design Decisions:</h2>
          <div class="xuelie">
            <ol>
              <li>After looking at all the sets of sketches, we decided to pick the pages that demonstrate the
                convenience of Almond, which is that users can have all the information in the app, such as looking up
                different. providers, setting up virtual calls with their doctors and reading FAQs.</li>
              <li>For the home page, we decided to include video call icons so that a user may jump into the call right
                away. This will be the first thing that the user sees when they enter the app.</li>
              <li> For the home page, along with the first video call buttons, we have the “Nearest hospitals” section
                right below the user’s profile. This way, we cover both remote and in-person appointments through the
                app, which we thought was appropriate for the problem we are trying to solve (allowing users to get
                faster care).</li>
              <li>The video screen looks the way that it does so that the user has the ability to hand it up when they
                need to and they get to turn off their camera and microphone the way that a typical facetime user
                interface does.</li>
              <li>After hanging up, we thought the user should be directed to rate the quality of the call they were in.
                We created a standard rating page where the user evaluates the call on several metrics out of five
                stars.</li>
              <li>On the same page, we also included a “Book again” button so that it is easier for the user to schedule
                another meeting with the doctor right away.</li>
              <li>The FAQ page is meant for the user to view the questions that are most commonly asked and attempt to
                find the questions that they may have. We formatted it like a typical FAQ page where we have the
                question and the response to the question right below it.</li>
              <li>The scheduling page is meant to give the user more information about the doctor that they are
                scheduling with. It is formatted like a typical information page (about a doctor), where the user
                receives information about the person that they are trying to book an appointment with.</li>

          <div class="xuelie">
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Calling page - </strong> Change the “calling…” button to “calling” to avoid confusion</li>
              <li> <strong>Redesign the Home page - </strong> including “upcoming appointments” and faq buttons, and
                take out the nearest hospitals</li>
              <li> <strong>Make a “meeting details” page - </strong>
                <ol>
                  <li>The meeting page is going to have more details about the doctor before you join the meeting. At
                    the moment we have the upcoming appointment button on the home screen and when you click on it, it
                    takes you to the video call. We should have something that takes us to the “meet your physician”
                    page and then from there, the user can facetime the physician</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Make a personal page </strong>that includes “past visits” and records </li>
              <li><strong> Make a bottom nav bar - </strong> make the middle icon a home button, me profile, providers,
                and FAQ to ensure consistent navigation between the pages </li>

The user wished that we only used one word to describe the same thing, so that it is less confusing on the app to find the calendar and hop in a meeting with the doctor.

                  For the care providers page, one user recommended that we included a button which specified that you wanted to book the appointment explicitly along with a button for more information which would make it easier for the user.

                   <li> 
                    We can change the color scheme of the home page so that it is easier to distinguish the hierarchy of elements and find specific elements on the page. If we change the color to have only two colors, for example, we expect it will be less confusing and overwhelming to the users on the home page.

                      One user noticed that the medication names are generic and not brand names, which could trigger different allergies.

                      Two users mentioned that the providers page should include more information. Such as a doctor’s approach to birth control. It’s very important, especially since politics is involved. It would also be good to have the information around abortion, plan b, iud, mamograms. This would make it easier for a woman to navigate the site and it would better cater to their needs. One user also noted that by including more information with procedures that pertain to women, it would better serve our mission of making women’s healthcare more accessible.
